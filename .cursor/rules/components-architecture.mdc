# Component Architecture

## UI Components

The application uses [shadcn/ui](mdc:https:/ui.shadcn.com/docs/tailwind-v4) components for a consistent design system. These components are located in [components/ui/](mdc:components/ui).

Key patterns:
- Components use Tailwind CSS v4 for styling
- Always add new shadcn/ui components via the CLI (`npx shadcn@latest add <component_name>`)
- Customize existing shadcn/ui components by modifying files in `components/ui/`

## Component Guidelines

- Use **PascalCase** for component files (e.g., `LoginForm.tsx`)
- Build components to be reusable and composable
- Keep UI components "dumb" - move business logic to hooks and services
- Use data-slot attributes for styling primitives

## Notable Components

- [components/site-header.tsx](mdc:components/site-header.tsx) - Main application header
- [components/sidebar.tsx](mdc:components/sidebar.tsx) - Application sidebar navigation
- [components/login-form.tsx](mdc:components/login-form.tsx) - Authentication form
- [components/data-table.tsx](mdc:components/data-table.tsx) - Reusable data table component

## Testing

Component tests are located in `__tests__` directories adjacent to the components they test.
Use Jest and React Testing Library for component testing.
