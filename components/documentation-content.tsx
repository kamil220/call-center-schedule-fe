      <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        This project was built using Next.js 14, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and shadcn/ui components.
        It follows modern development practices and implements a role-based authentication system.
      </p>
      
      <h2 id="architecture">Architecture</h2>
      <p>
        The application follows a clean architecture with separation of concerns. 
        Components are organized in a hierarchical structure, and state management 
        is handled through custom hooks and Zustand stores.
      </p>
      
      <h3 id="frontend-stack">Frontend Stack</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Next.js 14 (App Router)</li>
        <li>TypeScript</li>
        <li>Tailwind CSS</li>
        <li>shadcn/ui components</li>
        <li>Zustand for state management</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3 id="authentication">Authentication</h3>
      <p>
        The authentication system uses a token-based approach with proper cookie management.
        Roles and permissions are handled through a custom authorization system.
      </p>
      
      <h2 id="features">Features</h2>
      
      <h3 id="role-based-access">Role-based Access Control</h3>
      <p>
        The application implements a comprehensive role-based access control system 
        that restricts access to features based on user roles. Four main roles are supported:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Admin:</strong> Full access to all system features and settings</li>
        <li><strong>Planner:</strong> Access to scheduling and planning features</li>
        <li><strong>Manager:</strong> Team management and reporting capabilities</li>
        <li><strong>Agent:</strong> Customer service and ticket handling</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3 id="responsive-design">Responsive Design</h3>
      <p>
        The interface is fully responsive and adapts to different screen sizes.
        Mobile-first approach ensures optimal user experience across devices.
      </p>
      
      <h2 id="implementation-details">Implementation Details</h2>
      
      <h3 id="component-structure">Component Structure</h3>
      <p>
        Components are organized by functionality and reusability. Core UI components
        are based on shadcn/ui, providing consistency and accessibility.
      </p>
      
      <h3 id="state-management">State Management</h3>
      <p>
        Global state is managed through Zustand stores. Authentication state is
        persisted using cookies, ensuring a seamless user experience across page
        refreshes.
      </p>
      
      <h3 id="routing">Routing</h3>
      <p>
        Next.js App Router is used for routing, with protected routes that check
        user authentication and authorization before rendering content.
      </p>
      
      <h2 id="development-process">Development Process</h2>
      
      <h3 id="requirements-gathering">Requirements Gathering</h3>
      <p>
        The development process started with comprehensive requirements gathering,
        understanding the user personas and their needs in a call center environment.
      </p>
      
      <h3 id="design-decisions">Design Decisions</h3>
      <p>
        Key design decisions were made with a focus on scalability, maintainability,
        and user experience. The UI design prioritizes clarity and efficiency.
